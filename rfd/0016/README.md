# [RFD] Examination Screen & Media Recording via LiveKit Egress

This RFD adds durable recording of student media (screen share, and optionally
camera/microphone) during proctored examinations, on top of the LiveKit
integration introduced by [RFD 0012](../0012/README.md). Recordings are
captured server-side by the LiveKit Egress service as one object per published
track segment, stored in S3-compatible storage, indexed in a
`proctoring.recording` ledger table, and served post-hoc to a narrow evidence
review circle via an authz-gated, Range-capable backend content proxy.

The design targets **misconduct evidence secondary to in-person
invigilation**, not compliance-grade archival, and optimizes for storage and
egress-CPU cost via ultra-low-framerate publisher-side encoding presets rather
than server-side transcoding.

## Background

RFD 0012 gave proctored exams a live media plane: admitted students publish
camera, microphone, and screen-share tracks to a LiveKit SFU room
(`act{activity_id}-{slug}`, identity `user:{id}`), and invigilators watch a
live grid. Nothing is persisted: once a frame is rendered, it is gone. When a
suspected misconduct case arises after the exam, there is no footage to
consult; the only durable artifacts are ID/face captures, chat, flags, and
the audit log.

Our exams are **in-person proctored**: a human invigilator in the room is the
primary misconduct control. Recording is therefore a *secondary* evidence
layer that staff consult occasionally when an incident or appeal
arises, rather than a stream anyone watches routinely. This shapes the trade-offs
below: completeness and attributability matter more than visual smoothness,
and a recording gap is recorded as a fact rather than paged as an incident.

An earlier design discussion converged on periodic screenshots (one every ~5
seconds) to bound storage. That evolved into ultra-low-framerate video once we
observed that inter-frame delta encoding gives the same storage profile with
strictly better properties (see [Abandoned Ideas](#abandoned-ideas)).

The recording *infrastructure* was proven ahead of this RFD (2026-07-16):

- **Staging** runs `livekit/egress:v1.13.0` alongside the SFU, coordinating
  over a dedicated media-plane Valkey (`cobe-livekit-valkey`; the psrpc job
  bus uses only PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE/SETNX + hashes, verified Valkey-compatible).
  An end-to-end spike recorded a 100s 720p participant egress into RustFS,
  proving Valkey compatibility, in-cluster ICE, and multipart upload against
  pre-1.0 RustFS (cobe-deployment `dd78071`).
- **Simulate stack** gained an in-repo mockestra-style egress module
  (`internal/mock/livekitegress`, host-networked to reach the loopback RTC
  proxy) composed behind `mock.WithLiveKitEgress()`; a spike recorded into the
  stack MinIO (core branch `feat/simulate-livekit-egress`). CI test stacks do
  not opt in and add no extra containers.

The egress pod runs only track / track-composite / participant
modes: no RoomComposite, so no Chrome, no `SYS_ADMIN`, and low CPU.

## Proposal

One sentence per decision; each has its own section below.

1. **Purpose & coverage**: recordings are misconduct evidence secondary to
   in-person invigilation; whether and what to record is a per-activity
   policy (`none | screen | full`), with a quality preset.
2. **Mode**: track egress. One egress per published track, no transcoding,
   raw stream written as-is to S3. A student reconnect produces a new segment;
   segment boundaries are themselves evidence.
3. **Quality**: ultra-low-framerate publisher-side presets (floor ≈ 1080p /
   1–2 fps / 250 kbps, `contentHint: 'detail'`). Recording quality *is*
   publish quality; there is no server-side quality machinery.
4. **Lifecycle**: LiveKit webhooks (`track_published`, `egress_ended`, …)
   drive start/stop handlers on the proctoring side; a periodic ListEgress
   reconciliation sweep makes the system eventually correct. Temporal is
   deferred.
5. **Data model**: `proctoring.recording`, an append-mostly ledger, one row
   per egress segment, keyed on `session.id` like `capture`.
6. **Access**: chief invigilator + course-staff level only (strictly narrower
   than live proctoring); an authz-gated, Range-capable backend content proxy;
   every access is audit-logged.
7. **Failure stance**: gaps are derived and attributable, not paged
   per-student; OTel metrics + alerting cover systemic egress failure.

## Recording purpose & coverage

**Purpose: misconduct evidence.** The archive is rarely watched; when it is
watched, the questions are "what was on this student's screen at 14:03" and
"is this gap a disconnect or a system failure". This favours completeness,
attributability, and text legibility over smooth motion, and tolerates raw
per-track files (a reviewer-friendly composite can be produced on demand for
the rare incident case).

**Coverage: per-activity policy.** A `recording_mode` knob on the proctoring
policy selects `none` (default), `screen` (screen-share track only), or `full`
(screen + camera + microphone). Recording off is a supported value
everywhere. The knob uses the existing policy machinery, including the
staff-opt-in `apply_to_active` propagation (see [Policy schema](#policy-schema)).

## Recording mode: track egress

LiveKit Egress offers four modes. The choice is dominated by one physical
fact: **egress CPU scales per recording, and transcoding is expensive**
(roughly 0.5–1 CPU per transcoded stream). At exam scale (say 100 students ×
screen + camera), any transcoding mode needs a three-digit CPU count per room.

**Track egress** writes the SFU-received stream as-is (H.264 to mp4 container,
Opus to ogg), no re-encode, roughly an order of magnitude cheaper, and the
recorded quality is what was published, no generational loss. Its
constraint is lifecycle: a track egress ends whenever its track is unpublished, so
a student reconnect yields multiple files per source. For evidence purposes
this behaviour is useful: each file is a **segment** with accurate boundaries, and the
review timeline renders "screen feed gap 14:03–14:05, correlates with WS
disconnect" rather than concealing the gap.

Participant egress (transcoding, per-identity) and RoomComposite (headless
Chrome, `SYS_ADMIN`, 2–6 CPU) are rejected as the baseline; see
[Abandoned Ideas](#abandoned-ideas). Nothing prevents an operator from
running a one-off participant egress for a specific incident later; the
egress pod supports it.

## Quality: ultra-low-framerate publisher-side presets

With track egress there is no transcode, so **recording quality is publish
quality**: the control is in the student's browser at publish time, and both
egress CPU and storage shrink proportionally with it.

### Mechanics (verified against livekit-client 2.21.0)

Two levers per track, both accepted by
`setScreenShareEnabled(enabled, captureOptions, publishOptions)` /
`setCameraEnabled(...)`:

- **Capture constraint**: `ScreenShareCaptureOptions.resolution` is
  `{width, height, frameRate?}`, passed to `getDisplayMedia`.
- **Encoder cap**: `TrackPublishOptions.screenShareEncoding` takes
  `{maxBitrate, maxFramerate}`. The SDK ships presets down to
  `ScreenSharePresets.h360fps3` (3 fps / 200 kbps) and `VideoPreset` accepts
  arbitrary values (`new VideoPreset(1920, 1080, 250_000, 1)`).

Plus `contentHint: 'detail'`, which sets the browser's degradation preference
to maintain-resolution: under pressure it drops frames instead of blurring.
For evidence, a sharp 1 fps screen is preferable to a smooth blurred one.

The client plumbing point already exists: `usePublisher`
(`ui-v2/apps/client/app/lib/use-publisher.ts`) published with SDK
defaults before this RFD (`h1080fps15` ≈ 2.5 Mbps ≈ 2.2 GB/student for a 2 h exam). At
1080p / 1–2 fps / 250 kbps the *ceiling* is ~225 MB/student (~22 GB per
100-student exam), and realistic mostly-static exam screens land well below
it, because a video encoder spends bits proportional to **pixel change**, not
tick rate.

### Why 1–2 fps, not lower

The storage saving comes from delta encoding plus the bitrate cap, not from
pushing fps toward zero: a static screen costs almost nothing at 1 fps and at
0.2 fps alike. Staying at ≥1 fps gives:

- **Sub-interval events are captured.** An alt-tab flash or popup produces an
  encoded frame *because pixels changed*; periodic sampling misses
  anything shorter than its interval.
- **WebRTC mechanisms keep working.** Keyframe cadence, bandwidth estimation,
  and SFU/egress stall detection all assume a live stream; sub-1 fps is where
  fractional-frameRate constraint handling gets browser-dependent.

### Straw presets

| Preset | Screen | Camera | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `evidence_low` | 1080p / 1–2 fps / 250 kbps | 360p / 5 fps / 150 kbps | default for recorded exams |
| `standard` | 720p / 5 fps / 800 kbps (`h720fps5`) | 360p / 15 fps | mixed live+evidence |
| `high` | 1080p / 15 fps / 2.5 Mbps (`h1080fps15`, current SDK default) | 720p / 30 fps | current behaviour |

Numbers are server-owned and tunable without a client release (see
[Policy schema](#policy-schema)).

### Spike results (2026-07-16)

Both pre-implementation spikes ran on the simulate stack: four ~7-minute
**track-egress** recordings of a synthetic 1080p exam screen (code editor +
per-second countdown) published from headless Chrome (livekit-client 2.20.0,
H.264, `contentHint: 'detail'`, simulcast off, 250 kbps cap, 1–2 fps).

**Storage rate** (steady state; the first minute carries the one-time
keyframe and encoder settling, ~60–70 KB):

| Variant | Measured | Per 2 h exam |
|---|---|---|
| 2 fps, static screen (cursor blink only) | 0.9 kbps ≈ 0.4 MB/h | ~0.8 MB |
| 1 fps, active typing | 1.9 kbps ≈ 0.8 MB/h | ~1.6 MB |
| 2 fps, active typing | 2.5 kbps ≈ 1.1 MB/h | ~2.2 MB |
| 2 fps, continuous scrolling (worst realistic) | 7.8 kbps ≈ 3.4 MB/h | ~6.8 MB |

Delta encoding produced the storage profile the design assumed: measured rates sit two
orders of magnitude below the 250 kbps cap. The cap stays the *guarantee*
(~225 MB/student/2 h); the *expectation* for a 100-student 2 h exam is well
under 1 GB total, not 22 GB. Caveat: the canvas-rendered screen is cleaner
than a real desktop capture (no images, PDFs, or anti-aliasing noise);
treat real-world as several × the table, still well below the cap.

**Keyframes & seekability:** the recorded stream carries exactly **one
keyframe, at t=0**, regardless of fps: libwebrtc emits keyframes on demand
(PLI) and egress subscribes once, so no periodic keyframes arrive.
Consequences, all acceptable:

- Playback is correct start-to-end; duration and stream metadata are right
  (1080p, H.264 Constrained Baseline); text is pixel-crisp at these
  bitrates, and the countdown is legible to the second.
- Seeking decodes forward from t=0: measured ~0.3–0.5 s anywhere in a 7-min
  file, scaling roughly linearly with target position, giving single-digit seconds
  to cold-seek the tail of a 2 h file at 2 fps. Adequate for evidence review; if
  scrubbing UX becomes a requirement, the fix is a post-processing remux that injects
  keyframes (the deferred Temporal hook), not a publisher change.
- The mp4 is **not faststart** (moov atom at the tail): players must issue
  HTTP range requests against the stored object; browsers and MinIO/RustFS
  both do this natively.

**1 fps vs 2 fps:** both recorded correctly: no stall, no keyframe
starvation, exact frame cadence in the file. 1 fps saves only ~0.3 MB/h over
2 fps, so the floor preset stays **2 fps** for twice the temporal evidence
granularity. The `evidence_low` numbers are confirmed as specced.

**Track-egress mechanics confirmed:** H.264 in, `.mp4` out (egress appends
the extension to the templated object key); egress also uploads a small
`EG_*.json` manifest sidecar next to the media file, so the implementation
either sets `disable_manifest` in the file output or accounts for the
sidecar when listing objects.

### Remaining caveats
- **The track is shared with live invigilation.** Whatever the student
  publishes is what the invigilator grid renders. 1–3 fps screen share is
  acceptable live; a 1 fps *camera* would look frozen, so per-source
  presets use a higher camera floor.
- **Simulcast** (`screenShareSimulcastLayers`) is disabled for low presets:
  layered encoding at 1 fps provides no benefit and complicates what track egress records.
- **Enforcement is client-side.** The preset caps what our exam client
  publishes; that is the same trust model as all client capture today, stated
  here for the record.

## Lifecycle: webhooks + reconciliation sweep

Something must react every time a matching track is (re)published while the
policy says "record". The LiveKit server is configured to POST signed webhooks
(`track_published`, `track_unpublished`, `egress_started`, `egress_updated`,
`egress_ended`) to a new endpoint on our side.

**Fast path (webhook handlers):**

1. On `track_published`, resolve room name + identity `user:{id}` to the
   proctoring session, read the session's *effective* `policy_snapshot`, and if
   the source matches `recording_mode`, insert a `starting` recording row and
   call `StartTrackEgress` with a per-request object key and S3 credentials.
   Non-student identities (invigilators, the hidden `kind=EGRESS` participant)
   do not match a session and are skipped.
2. On `egress_started` / `egress_updated`, upsert status by `egress_id`.
3. On `egress_ended`, mark `complete | failed | aborted`, store `end_reason`,
   `byte_size`, timestamps.

**Slow path (reconciliation sweep):** a periodic pass per active exam room
compares expected state (admitted sessions × policy × currently-published
tracks) against `ListEgress` and the ledger: starts missing egresses (missed
webhook, failed start, policy flipped on mid-exam), stops orphaned ones
(policy flipped off), and repairs rows for terminal events we never received.
**The sweep is required for correctness**: LiveKit webhook delivery is
roughly at-least-once with limited retries and no ordering guarantee, so webhooks
are only the low-latency fast path; the sweep is what makes the system
eventually correct.

**Races and idempotency** (each bounded and testable):

- Duplicate webhook causing a double start: serialized by the partial unique index
  (one live egress per `track_sid`; on 23505, ignore).
- Track unpublished before `StartTrackEgress` lands: the start fails; ignore.
- `egress_ended` before `egress_started` was processed: upsert by `egress_id`
  tolerates out-of-order arrival.
- StartEgress itself fails: **no row**, the ledger records only egresses that
  existed. Failures go to OTel and the sweep retries while the track lives.

**Accepted cost (the start gap):** the sequence publish, webhook, StartEgress,
egress-subscribes loses the first ~1–2 s of each segment. Acceptable for evidence
behind an in-person invigilator; recorded here so it is not mistaken for a
bug later.

### Coupling to the proctoring lifecycle

Recording has **no state machine of its own and no explicit sync** with the
RFD 0012 session FSM. The coupling is one-directional and derived: the
proctoring lifecycle drives the media plane (which tracks exist), and the
media plane drives recording (which egresses run). There is no
"exam started, begin recording" event: **publication is the trigger**. A
track can only exist for an *admitted* session (the media shell mounts
post-admission, under `live_media`), so recording inherits every
admission-side gate transitively: nothing is recorded during
`pending_device_proof` / `awaiting_capture` / `awaiting_attach` (identity
evidence there is `capture`'s job), and the `track_published` handler
resolving identity to session only finds admitted sessions.

Per lifecycle event:

| Proctoring event | Media-plane effect | Recording effect |
|---|---|---|
| Session admitted, shell mounts | tracks publish | webhooks start segments (policy permitting) |
| Disconnect / reconnect (reentry) | tracks unpublish, republish (new SIDs) | segment ends (`track_unpublished`), new segment rows; reentry keeps one session row, so history accumulates under one `session_id` |
| Session locked (invigilator lock / force-submit) | client teardown unpublishes tracks | segments end naturally; the sweep covers a lingering client |
| Re-seat mid-exam | nothing (sessions are not room-keyed) | later segments carry the new `room_id` snapshot |
| `apply_to_active` policy flip | nothing immediate | sweep starts egresses for live tracks (mode on) / stops running ones (mode off); quality applies at next publish |
| Room `ended` (terminal) | all participants torn down, tracks unpublish | all segments end; the room leaves the sweep's active set |

The sweep implements the synchronization, stated as one invariant:
*expected egresses = admitted, unlocked sessions × recording policy ×
currently-published tracks*. Every transition above changes an input
to that equation; no proctoring code needs to know recording exists.

The reverse direction is absent: recording does not gate the FSM.
Admission does not wait for an egress to start, a lock does not wait for
segments to finalize (`egress_ended` arriving after room end is just a late
terminal row update), and an egress failure does not block or flag the
attempt (see [Failure stance](#failure-stance--observability)). The only
post-hoc join between the two subsystems is the evidence timeline: recording
rows key on `session.id`, so segments and gaps line up against the same
session's WS/media events at review.

### Why not the alternatives

| Lifecycle lever | Webhooks | SFU auto-track-egress | Temporal per student |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filter by source (screen-only) | ✅ per-track | ❌ records every track | ✅ same APIs |
| Filter by participant (skip invigilators) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mid-exam policy change | ✅ | ❌ fixed at room create | ✅ |
| Restart after egress failure | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-request key template / S3 creds | ✅ | ⚠️ one template at room create | ✅ |
| Start gap | ~1–2 s | near-zero | ~same as webhooks |
| Orchestration code owned | moderate | none | most |

Auto-track-egress trades every filter and every mid-exam decision for a
near-zero start gap, a conflict with policy-driven coverage. Temporal
has *identical* control (it calls the same APIs) wrapped in durable state we
do not yet need; the webhook handler is where a workflow would be
started, so this choice does not foreclose Temporal if recordings later grow
post-processing steps (stitching, on-demand transcode, encryption).

## Data model

One table. Append-mostly ledger; rows mutate only on egress status
transitions.

```sql
-- recording — append-mostly ledger of track-egress SEGMENTS. One row per LiveKit egress
-- (one track publish → one egress → one object). A student reconnect = new track SID =
-- new row; gaps between segments are DERIVED at review time from segment boundaries +
-- session events, never stored. Keyed like capture: session.id + (activity_id, user_id)
-- denorm guards. Objects are plaintext in the recordings bucket (SSE at rest) — no DEK
-- columns; unlike capture, egress uploads directly so there is no app-side encrypt hook.
CREATE TABLE proctoring.recording (

    session_id   BIGINT  NOT NULL,

    source       TEXT    NOT NULL,      -- LiveKit track source
    track_sid    TEXT    NOT NULL,      -- TR_… ; republish ⇒ new SID ⇒ new row

    updated_at   TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT proctoring_recording_source_check
        CHECK (source IN ('camera','microphone','screen_share','screen_share_audio')),
    CONSTRAINT proctoring_recording_status_check
        CHECK (status IN ('starting','active','complete','failed','aborted')),
    CONSTRAINT proctoring_recording_session_id_fkey
        FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES proctoring.session(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT proctoring_recording_activity_id_fkey
        FOREIGN KEY (activity_id) REFERENCES core.activity(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    CONSTRAINT proctoring_recording_user_id_fkey
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES core."user"(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
CREATE INDEX idx_proctoring_recording_session_id    ON proctoring.recording(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_proctoring_recording_activity_user ON proctoring.recording(activity_id, user_id);
-- ONE live egress per track: serializes the duplicate-webhook double-start race on 23505,
-- same trick as idx_proctoring_capture_active.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_proctoring_recording_live
    ON proctoring.recording(track_sid) WHERE ended_at IS NULL;
CREATE TRIGGER set_proctoring_recording_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON proctoring.recording
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION core.set_current_timestamp_updated_at();
```

Design choices:

- **Keyed on `session.id`, like `capture`.** The media shell mounts only
  post-admission, so a session always exists when a student track publishes.
  The `(activity_id, user_id)` denorm guards match capture, and the session
  identity FK chain already guarantees a roster reconcile cannot
  cascade-delete evidence. The CASCADE matches capture: voiding an
  attempt (explicit admin session delete) drops its recording rows; the S3
  objects need a cleanup step, owned by the retention work.
- **Row identity = egress; `egress_id` UNIQUE** makes handler idempotency a
  natural upsert. The partial unique index on `track_sid WHERE ended_at IS
  NULL` is the schema-level guard against double-start.
- **`object_key` NOT NULL from insertion**: we template the filepath in the
  StartEgress request, so the key is known before the first byte lands, and
  the sweep can check object existence for any row. The template uses numeric
  ids only (`recordings/act{activity_id}/u{user_id}/s{session_id}/{source}-{segment_ulid}.{ext}`,
  where `{ext}` is `mp4` for video sources and `ogg` for the microphone/screen_share_audio
  tracks) because egress renders identity strings verbatim into keys; `user:999`
  would put a `:` in the object key (legal in S3, problematic on a filesystem). The leaf is a
  minted ULID, not `{egress_id}`: the filepath is set in the StartEgress request
  while the egress id exists only in its response.
- **No gap rows.** A gap is derived at review time from segment boundaries
  joined against session events (`last_known_media_state`, WS disconnects)
  that already exist; storing gaps would denormalize a computation and risk
  drift.
- **`held` / `purged_at` are dormant** until retention jobs exist; adding them
  now means the evidence contract does not need a later migration.

## Policy schema

Two flat keys extend the stable `PolicySnapshot` contract (persisted verbatim
in `proctoring.session.policy_snapshot` and embedded in the session-bearer
JWT):

```json
{
  "device_proof": false,
  "live_media": false,
  "identity_verification": "disabled",
  "recording_mode": "none",        // "none" | "screen" | "full"
  "recording_quality": "standard"  // "evidence_low" | "standard" | "high"
}
```

- **Flat keys, not a nested object.** This matches house style and diffs cleanly
  in the propagation machinery. `WithDefaults()` normalizes empty to
  `"none"` / `"standard"`, so every previously-persisted snapshot and
  already-issued JWT reads as recording-off, which is the safe default and needs no migration.
- **Validation at `PUT /config`:** `recording_mode != none` requires
  `live_media = true`, because tracks that are not published cannot be recorded.
- **Propagation:** both keys use `apply_to_active` like `live_media`
  (forward-only re-stamp + durable `policy_update` frame); `device_proof`
  stays the one field that does not propagate. Mid-exam semantics: *mode* flips take
  effect through the sweep (record-on starts egresses for already-live
  tracks; record-off stops running ones); *quality* applies at next publish
  only, with no forced republish of a live track (a reconnect picks it up).
- **Names in the snapshot, numbers in the connection response.** The snapshot
  and JWT carry only preset *names* (stable contract stays small). The
  LiveKit token/connection response gains a `recording_params` block with
  resolved `{width, height, max_framerate, max_bitrate, content_hint}` per
  source, keyed by `screen` and `camera` only (nil when `recording_mode=none`,
  camera present only under `full`); the client applies whatever numbers arrive. The server owns the
  name-to-numbers map, so tuning a preset does not need a client release.
- **Server-side decisions** (webhook handler, sweep) read the session's
  *effective* `policy_snapshot`, consistent with the `live_media` gate,
  not the raw activity config.

## Access & evidence semantics

- **Who:** chief invigilator + course-staff-level permission on the activity.
  Room invigilators get *no* post-hoc access by default; their job is live,
  and evidence review is a strictly narrower circle than invigilation. (Exact
  OpenFGA relation, reuse of the activity manage permission vs a dedicated
  `can_review_recordings`, is settled at implementation; the principle is
  "strictly narrower than live proctoring".)
- **List:** activity-scoped endpoint with a user filter returning ledger rows;
  the review UI derives the per-student timeline (segments + attributable
  gaps) by joining against session events.
- **Fetch:** `GET .../recordings/{recording_id}/content`, an authz-gated
  backend content proxy served via `http.ServeContent` with Range support,
  not a presigned GET, because the object store is a ClusterIP-only service (a
  presigned `http://<store>:9000/...` URL is neither routable from a browser
  nor allowed alongside an HTTPS page). Same shape as the pipeline
  stdio-artifact proxy, which itself dropped presigning for an authz-gated
  proxy (RFD 0015 Phase 7, `GetResultArtifact` in
  `internal/api/pipeline/run.go`, cf. `result_read`). Range requests are served
  natively through the proxy, so video seeking needs no extra machinery. (Spike-verified: the
  recorded mp4 keeps its moov atom at the tail, so range support is
  required for browser playback.)
- **Every access writes a `proctoring.audit_log` row before any byte is
  served**: the row commits ahead of `http.ServeContent`, so an access that
  cannot be audited is refused; an access to the evidence is itself a recorded
  event, which supports future institutional privacy-policy requirements. Rows are deduped
  server-side per `(actor, recording)` over a 30-minute window, so the
  many range connections from one scrubbing session produce one row (a 1 h playback lands ~2 rows, not the
  ~30 a per-request mint would have produced).
- **Encryption stance:** recordings are plaintext objects in a dedicated
  `recordings` bucket with server-side encryption at rest. Capture-style
  envelope encryption **cannot** apply as-is: egress uploads directly to S3
  with no app-side encrypt hook. If evidence policy demands
  client-managed keys, that becomes a post-processing step (and the natural
  trigger to revisit Temporal); out of scope for v1.
- **Retention:** real-exam capacity/retention (cap ≈22 GB per 100-student
  exam at `evidence_low`; spike-measured expectation well under 1 GB; staging
  RustFS is 10 Gi) is a deployment decision deferred with the retention
  jobs. The schema (`held`, `purged_at`) is already shaped
  for it.

## Failure stance & observability

Recording failure is **detected and recorded, not paged per-student**. The
exam itself is protected by the in-person invigilator; the archive is
secondary evidence.

- Gaps are derived and *attributable*: segment boundaries join against session
  events to distinguish "student disconnected" from "system failure"
  (`end_reason` carries the raw LiveKit error).
- The sweep restarts failed egresses while the track lives, and repairs ledger
  rows for missed webhooks.
- OTel per OBSERVABILITY.md: spans on webhook handlers and sweep passes;
  metrics for egress starts/failures/restarts and sweep repairs; alerting
  thresholds on *systemic* failure rates (an egress pod dying fails many
  egresses at once, which is an infra alert, not N student incidents).

## Implementation surface

- **core / proctoring:** webhook receiver endpoint (LiveKit-JWT-signature
  verified; whether the HTTP route terminates on the core router and forwards
  to the proctoring extension over NATS, or the extension listens itself, is
  resolved at implementation to match existing patterns), egress service
  (StartTrackEgress/StopEgress + per-request S3 credentials, minted and
  revoked like the grading runtime's per-run creds; static creds in egress
  config are the fallback), reconciliation sweep, `PolicySnapshot` +
  validation + propagation extension, recording list/fetch endpoints + authz
  + audit, migration for `proctoring.recording`.
- **ui-v2:** `usePublisher` applies `recording_params` from the connection
  response at publish time; invigilator grid filters the hidden `kind=EGRESS`
  participant (explicit test: egress joins rooms as a hidden participant);
  post-hoc review surface (list + player) for the evidence circle.
- **Deployment:** webhook URL + signing-key knob in every LiveKit deployment
  (staging manifest, simulate stack); egress infra itself is already deployed
  in both environments.
- **Pre-implementation spikes: done** (2026-07-16, simulate stack); see
  [Spike results](#spike-results-2026-07-16). Preset numbers confirmed; no
  open questions block implementation.

## Abandoned Ideas

**Periodic screenshots (one per ~5 s).** The predecessor design. Ultra-low-fps
video is preferable: delta encoding yields the same storage for static content
while capturing sub-interval events (screenshots miss anything
shorter than the sampling period); and it reuses the existing pipeline
(student already publishes the screen; egress uploads server-side) instead of
needing a second client capture/upload path with its own batching, offline
buffering, and tamper-evidence handling.

**RoomComposite egress.** One recording per room via headless Chrome:
requires `SYS_ADMIN`, 2–6 CPU, and produces a mixed grid not usable as
per-student evidence. Rejected; the egress pod excludes it.

**Participant egress as the baseline.** Per-identity composites are
reviewer-friendly but transcode (~0.5–1 CPU per student per stream, a
three-digit CPU count per exam room) and still end on participant disconnect,
providing no lifecycle simplicity. Retained as an on-demand tool for incident
cases, not the baseline.

**SFU auto-track-egress.** Zero orchestration code and near-zero start gap,
but fixed at room creation: no source filter (screen-only impossible), no
participant filter (records invigilator tracks), no mid-exam policy change,
and nothing re-arms after an egress failure. Conflicts with
policy-driven coverage.

**Temporal-first lifecycle.** Identical control to webhooks (same APIs) at
the cost of durable state that would mostly mirror what LiveKit already
keeps. Deferred, not rejected: the webhook handler is where a
workflow would be started if recordings grow multi-step post-processing.

**Stored gap rows.** Gaps are a computation over segment boundaries and
session events; storing them denormalizes and drifts.

**Envelope encryption of recordings.** No app-side hook exists on the
egress-to-S3 path; parity with capture would require a post-processing pass.
Bucket SSE now; revisit only if evidence policy demands client-managed keys.

**Sub-1 fps capture.** Negligible storage gain over 1–2 fps (delta encoding
already zeroes static content) while risking browser fractional-frameRate
handling, stall detection, and keyframe starvation.
