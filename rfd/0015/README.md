# [RFD] Grading Runtime

This RFD defines the **runtime** that executes a v3 pipeline config against a submission and turns the result into a score. It is the follow-up runtime RFD that [RFD 0013](../0013/README.md) and [RFD 0014](../0014/README.md) repeatedly defer to: 0013 froze the *config language* and the `exec_result` data contract but explicitly left "how `exec` blocks are dispatched, what isolation runs them, workflow orchestration, worker lifecycle, container management" out of scope; 0014 froze the *document-to-config generator* and left "the execution flow" and "concurrent save / grading-run ordering" to the runtime.

Scope is the **execution model** (who runs the DAG and where), the **container-runner abstraction** (how a grading job is placed on an orchestrator), the **command channel** between the orchestrator and the in-container executor, the **result/score persistence reshape** required to honour the 0013 contract, and the **trigger/lifecycle** wiring. The v3 language, the formula semantics, and the document-driven generator are inputs to this RFD rather than subjects of it. Where this RFD touches a 0013/0014 contract it implements it verbatim; it does not renegotiate it.

This RFD records decisions and their rationale rather than an implementation plan. Concrete table DDL, Go types, activity signatures, and config keys are implementation work that follows from the decisions here.

## Background

ZINC grades a student submission by running an instructor-authored pipeline and feeding the pipeline's per-test outcomes into a formula that produces a score. Three layers were reshaped in sequence:

- **[RFD 0013](../0013/README.md)** replaced the Concourse-shaped v1/v2 pipeline languages with v3: a score-blind pipeline of `exec` blocks (each stage runs one command across one or more *scenarios*), and a separate full-HCL *formula* that consumes the pipeline's results. 0013 committed to a precise **`exec_result`** contract (per (stage, scenario): `command`, `args`, `exit_code`, `timed_out`, `skipped`, `error`, timestamps, and object-storage URIs for stdin/stdout/stderr, and no score), and to the reshape by which the formula reads results as `pipeline.<name>.scenarios[<code>][<stage>]`. It did **not** decide where results are stored, how stdio reaches object storage, how runs are dispatched, or how the formula is evaluated.
- **[RFD 0014](../0014/README.md)** made the examination document the source of truth and the pipeline + formula configs derived artifacts, materialised by a deterministic generator on every save. It committed to a strict **activity ↔ document ↔ config 1:1:1** cardinality, configs that mutate in place (no per-run snapshot), and per-question marking schemes. It left re-grading mechanics and the save-vs-grading-run ordering to the runtime.
- The **code state this RFD responded to** reflected this lineage. The v3 parser + validate phase, the 0014 generator (`internal/pipeline/configgen`), and the editor schema generator (`internal/pipeline/schemagen`) all existed. The execution layer did **not**: the Concourse adapter and the ghost-webhook handler were removed when 0013 landed, the pipeline run endpoints returned `501 Not Implemented`, and the JetStream delivery/collection consumers were registered but no-op (`internal/api/pipeline/event.go`). The database schema for results and scores still carried the *old* ghost-webhook/Concourse shape: a per-result `score`, a flattened `case_code`, a `{success, failed, timeout}` status enum, and an `evaluation.score.items` log appended one entry per webhook callback. None of that matched the 0013 `exec_result` contract.

So the runtime had no prior implementation on the execution side, sitting on top of a config/language layer that was already built and a persistence layer that had to be reshaped to the 0013 contract.

A **reference implementation exists** and is the basis for this design: a separate Temporal-based grading runtime that dispatches one container per run through a pluggable runner abstraction (Docker / Kubernetes / Nomad), where an in-container worker fetches the submission, runs the pipeline, and reports back over a per-run Temporal task queue. This RFD ports that model into ZINC's idioms: Uber FX modules, the existing `internal/temporal` worker pattern (mirroring the `EnvironmentBuilderWorkflow`), `internal/dind` / `internal/sandbox`, `internal/registry`, the NATS extension system, and the `fault` error model. It adapts that model where ZINC differs: it relocates the DAG logic out of the container and into the core workflow, and it uses **`ghost`** (ZINC's existing single-command executor) as the in-container agent rather than a bespoke binary.

## Terminology

Building on [RFD 0013 § Terminology](../0013/README.md#terminology):

- **Pipeline run**: one execution of one `pipeline "<name>"` block against one submission. A config with N pipeline blocks produces N runs per submission, executed in parallel. **One row per pipeline** (see [Decision 6](#decisions-at-a-glance)).
- **Submission grading**: all pipeline runs for one (config, delivery) pair, plus the formula evaluation that aggregates them. Realised as a parent workflow rather than a table.
- **Runner**: a backend that places a grading job on an orchestrator (Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad) and manages its lifecycle. The **runner registry** holds an ordered set of runners and chooses one per dispatch.
- **Executor**: colloquially, a runner backend (a Nomad executor, a Kubernetes executor).
- **Ghost agent**: `ghost` running in its long-lived agent mode inside the grading container. It connects out to Temporal, accepts resolved exec commands, runs each in the shared container filesystem, captures stdio to object storage, and reports structured results. It contains **no pipeline logic**.
- **Resolved exec spec**: a single scenario's command after 0013 inheritance/merge (command, args, env, stdin, stdout/stderr paths, timeout, workdir). It is the unit of work handed to the ghost agent.

## Proposal

The runtime is **core-orchestrated with an in-container executor agent**. The core Temporal workflow owns the pipeline DAG, the fan-out across pipelines, and the fan-in, and drives formula evaluation at fan-in (as a report-extension step; see [§ Execution flow](#execution-flow)). The container is a long-lived executor that runs the single commands it is told to run and reports what happened. The orchestrator and the container communicate over **Temporal itself**: the container is a Temporal worker on a per-run task queue, and each exec command is an activity. There is no callback channel and no inbound connection to the container.

### Decisions at a glance

The whole design in one table; each row links to its rationale.

| # | Area | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Execution topology](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes) | Core's Temporal workflow owns the DAG, fan-out/in, and formula. `ghost` is a long-lived, DAG-blind executor that runs one resolved exec per command and reports back. |
| 2 | [Runner registry](#2-the-runner-registry-and-executors) | One container/job per pipeline run, placed via a pluggable **runner registry** that satisfies config-declared resource/security constraints. Each backend is its own Temporal task queue; dispatch routes to the chosen queue, failover picks another. The contract is mandatory even if fewer backends ship. |
| 3 | [Command channel](#3-the-command-channel-ghost-as-a-temporal-worker) | The channel **is** Temporal: ghost is a worker on a per-run task queue, each exec is an activity, ghost dials *out* to Temporal. A readiness handshake gates the first command. |
| 4 | [Result contract](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape) | Full reconcile with 0013's score-blind `exec_result` contract. The legacy ghost-webhook result/score shape retires. |
| 5 | [Formula evaluation](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation) | The grading workflow evaluates the formula at fan-in, after all pipeline runs of a submission complete. Hard-fail yields ungraded, per 0013. |
| 6 | [Run cardinality](#6-one-pipeline-run-per-pipeline) | One `pipeline.run` per pipeline label per delivery. "Submission grading" is the set of runs for a (config, delivery). |
| 7 | [Submission delivery](#7-submission-and-asset-delivery) | The ghost agent fetches the submission and derived assets from object storage itself, using per-run scoped credentials, matching the reference implementation. |
| 8 | [Credentials & auth](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent) | A per-run credential bundle (a Temporal auth token + STS-scoped object-storage credentials), minted at dispatch, short-TTL, revoked on completion. |
| 9 | [Isolation](#9-isolation-two-independent-layers) | Two independent layers: per-exec process sandbox inside ghost, and container-level isolation chosen by the runner backend. |
| 10 | [Observability](#10-observability-and-log-handling) | Temporal carries control + structured results + progress. Final stdio lives in object storage (the contract). **Live log tail is deferred.** |
| 11 | [Triggering](#11-triggering-and-lifecycle) | Grading runs as its own extension/worker, triggered by the JetStream delivery/collection consumers that were no-op before this RFD. |
| 12 | [Admission control](#12-admission-control-and-batch-fan-out) | No application-level admission gate. Bursty fan-out is absorbed by Temporal worker tuning (concurrent-execution caps, task-queue rate limits); load probing is advisory input to backend selection only. |

### 1. Execution topology: core orchestrates, ghost executes

The decisive question is *where the pipeline DAG runs*. The reference implementation puts the entire DAG inside the container (the in-container worker parses the HCL and runs every stage). This RFD does **not**: the DAG, the dependency gating, the scenario fan-out, the fan-in across pipelines, and the formula all live in the **core Temporal workflow**. `ghost` runs one resolved exec per command it receives and reports the outcome.

The property that makes this work is that **the container persists for the whole run**. A pipeline's stages share filesystem state (`compile` writes `q1.out`, `execute` reads it). Because there is one long-lived container per run and one long-lived ghost agent inside it, successive exec commands see each other's side effects, as if a single in-container worker had run them. The difference is only *who decides what to run next*: the core workflow, which already holds the parsed config and therefore the dependency graph.

Why relocate the DAG into core:

- **The orchestration logic and the language live together.** The parser, the dependency graph, the scenario expansion, and (after this RFD) the parse phase all live in `internal/pipeline`. Putting the DAG engine in the same place as the language it executes avoids a second HCL interpreter inside ghost and avoids shipping language changes into a container image on every grammar change.
- **Fan-in is already a core concern.** The formula aggregates across *all* of a submission's pipeline runs ([Decision 5](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation)). That join cannot happen inside any single container; it has to be orchestrated centrally. Having the same workflow own both the per-pipeline DAG and the cross-pipeline join keeps both in one component.
- **ghost stays small and reusable.** ghost is already a single-command executor with sandboxing and object-storage upload. Keeping it DAG-blind means the runtime's executor extends what ghost already is instead of rewriting it; see [Decision 13 lineage in § Abandoned ideas](#ghost-as-the-dag-orchestrator).
- **Temporal gets per-exec visibility.** Each exec is an activity, so retries, timeouts, and tracing are per-command and native, rather than contained in an opaque in-container run.

The cost is the number of activities (a stage with M scenarios is M activities, and an exam has many stages) and a hard dependency on the container being reachable as a Temporal worker for the run's duration ([Decision 3](#3-the-command-channel-ghost-as-a-temporal-worker)). Both are judged acceptable; the alternative of an in-container DAG is recorded in [Abandoned ideas](#ghost-as-the-dag-orchestrator).

Two consequences of this split that the runtime must commit to:

- **Intra-stage scenario fan-in is the workflow's job, and is as real as the cross-pipeline fan-in.** A stage's scenarios run as independent parallel commands; the workflow collects their results, derives the stage's state per the [0013 stage-state table](../0013/README.md#stage-block), and only then gates downstream stages (setting `skipped` on a gated stage's scenarios). The per-stage aggregation is a first-class part of the DAG engine.
- **An exec command mutates shared, non-transactional container state, so an exec is not freely retryable.** Because stages share one container filesystem, re-running a command that already half-wrote its output (a killed-mid-write artifact, a partially-consumed input) is not idempotent the way a pure activity is. The committed posture is **fail-fast**: a failed exec fails its stage (and gates downstream) rather than being retried into ambiguous filesystem state. Infrastructure-level retries (the agent never received the command) are distinct from re-running a command that already ran; only the former is safe, and the runtime must keep them distinct.

**Command granularity is per-exec (decided).** The agent's command contract is "one resolved exec spec in, one `exec_result` out": one Temporal activity per `(stage, scenario)`, rather than a batch. The alternative, handing the agent a whole stage's scenarios in a single activity to shrink Temporal history, was weighed and rejected. Because the command channel *is* Temporal (each command is an activity), the dispatch unit and the agent's contract are the same choice; keeping it at one-exec keeps the agent simple and makes **every scenario a first-class Temporal activity with its own lifecycle, timeout, retry classification, and trace span**. That per-scenario visibility is the property the progress UI is built on (see [Observability](#10-observability-and-log-handling)). The cost is more history events for wide stages (an examination's batched MC/SA stage can hold dozens of scenarios); this is **accepted**. The one ceiling is Temporal's per-workflow history limit, which an unusually wide single stage could approach; the mitigations if this limit is reached are `continue-as-new` and capping concurrent scheduling, neither needed now (per-pipeline-run workflows already partition history, so only one very large batched stage, not a whole exam, approaches it).

### 2. The runner registry and executors

A grading run is one container (Docker) or one job/allocation (Kubernetes Job, Nomad batch job): **one per pipeline run**, rather than a shared or pre-warmed container. One-per-run is what makes the scoped-credential model ([Decision 8](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent)) and the shared-filesystem-across-stages property ([Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes)) work cleanly: the container's lifetime *is* the run's lifetime, and its credentials, isolation, and object-storage prefixes are scoped to one submission.

Placement goes through a **runner registry**: an ordered set of named runner backends behind a common interface. In Temporal terms **each backend is its own task queue** (a Docker executor queue, a Kubernetes executor queue, a Nomad executor queue), so dispatch reduces to *choosing a backend* and scheduling the placement activity on that backend's queue, and failover is choosing a different queue. The interface is the artifact that must be defined and is **mandatory**, even though the first cut may implement only one or two backends (with Docker-only, the set collapses to a single executor queue). It must express:

- **Dispatch** a job for a run (image, the resolved resource/security constraints, the per-run credential bundle, the per-run task-queue identity) onto the chosen backend's queue.
- **Lifecycle**: verify a job actually started (catch image-pull failures and immediate crashes fast), check liveness during the run, and clean up.
- **Failover** across backends in order, with a circuit breaker so an unhealthy backend is skipped briefly rather than retried repeatedly.
- **Load-awareness**: an optional probe so the registry can prefer a less-loaded or GPU-capable backend.

Committing to the interface now, even with one executor behind it, is the decision: it forces the dispatch/lifecycle contract to be backend-agnostic from day one, so adding Kubernetes or Nomad later is an implementation task rather than a redesign. **Which** backends ship first is an open question ([Open questions](#open-questions)); ZINC today has only a Docker-in-Docker path (`internal/dind`) and no Kubernetes/Nomad client, so Docker is the first executor, with the others designed-for but not necessarily built.

**Resource limits and hardware** (CPU/memory/storage, optional GPU) and the container's **security posture** are declared in the **pipeline config** rather than chosen by the runtime: the registry is a *constraint-satisfying scheduler* that places a run on a backend able to honour its declared constraints. The exact config surface (granularity, defaults) is a small follow-up to [RFD 0013](../0013/README.md); 0013 omitted it because a sensible default suffices for the common case; this RFD depends on it as the source of dispatch inputs but does not specify it. Each scarce constraint carries a **`required` vs `best-effort`** sense: a `required` GPU with no schedulable backend is a placement failure (fail fast), while `best-effort` permits the accelerator-less fallback. Because a fallback that silently runs CPU-only when a pipeline needs a GPU would produce wrong scores, **whether the GPU was actually provided must be observable to the run**.

**The image and the agent.** The image a run dispatches is the activity's **environment image**: the instructor's built environment (the existing environment-builder output), or a **default environment** when none is configured. Every such image is a **standard base image** (a plain distribution image such as `debian-slim`, configurable per deployment) with the **ghost agent injected at environment-build time**. The environment builder already produces an image by committing a configured container; sourcing the ghost binary and writing it into that image (at `/usr/local/bin/ghost`) becomes one more build step, so the builder enforces agent presence as an invariant rather than a property inherited from a special base or remembered by the instructor.

This drops an earlier "pre-built sandbox base image that every custom image must derive from" framing. Coupling every environment to one ghost-carrying base image (and having the builder merely *verify* the agent is present) is replaced by injecting the agent into whatever standard base the deployment chooses, which removes the inheritance constraint and makes the agent version a property of the *build* rather than of whatever base someone started from. The **no-custom-environment default is produced by this same path** (the configured base with no instructor customization, agent injected, built once), so there is a single image-build mechanism and no separately-maintained "base grading image."

The ghost binary's **source is runtime configuration**: an **object-storage location** (where the agent's own CI publishes each build) **or a release URL**, arch-qualified and resolved at build time. This decouples the agent's release cadence from the image build: rolling the agent forward is a configuration change plus an image rebuild. Injecting-and-baking, rather than injecting at dispatch, is chosen because a self-contained image runs identically across Docker/Kubernetes/Nomad, which keeps the runner abstraction backend-agnostic. The cost is version skew between a baked agent and the orchestrator, caught by the protocol-version check at readiness ([Decision 3](#3-the-command-channel-ghost-as-a-temporal-worker)): a stale agent in an un-rebuilt image fails fast with "agent too old, rebuild environment" rather than a confusing activity-type mismatch.

The portability the registry promises is real but not free, and the abstraction should acknowledge where backends differ rather than imply a clean uniformity:

- **Job identity leaks.** The opaque handle returned by dispatch is a Docker container id, a Kubernetes Job name, or a Nomad job id, and some lifecycle facts are backend-shaped (a pod name, a Docker secrets mount). The interface carries an opaque identity plus the owning runner's name; that some detail is backend-specific is accepted leakage. One consequence: failover is a *pre-dispatch* decision, because once a run is placed on a backend, its identity is only meaningful to that backend.
- **Credential delivery and lifecycle differ per backend**, and the security properties differ with them: a Kubernetes Secret is RBAC-controlled and at-rest-encryptable but not self-expiring (it outlives a finished Job unless explicitly reclaimed); a Nomad job-spec env block is visible to anyone with read access to the job and is best replaced by a secrets-manager/Variables path in production; a Docker env/file delivery is visible to host inspection. The bundle model ([Decision 8](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent)) is uniform; its *delivery* is not, and the weaker deliveries must be hardened or avoided where student code runs.
- **"Verify it started" and "is it alive" are backend-shaped.** Pod phases and image-pull-backoff (Kubernetes), allocation client-status (Nomad), and container state (Docker) carry different diagnostic richness and different asynchronous-settling behaviour. The interface expresses the *intent* (started / alive / cleaned up); the diagnostic fidelity it can surface is backend-dependent, and startup timeouts must be sized for the slowest settling chain, not only image-pull time.
- **Egress-only is a property of the agent (it binds no listener), not a property the platform enforces.** On Kubernetes it must be backed by a deny-ingress network policy; on Docker/Nomad by network configuration; otherwise "no ingress" is true of the agent but not of the container. See [Decision 9](#9-isolation-two-independent-layers) and the egress note in [Observability](#10-observability-and-log-handling).

### 3. The command channel: ghost as a Temporal worker

The orchestrator and the container talk over **Temporal**, not a bespoke protocol. Concretely:

- On dispatch, the run gets a **per-run task queue** (e.g. keyed by run id). Only this run's ghost agent polls it.
- The ghost agent boots, connects **out** to the Temporal frontend, and registers a small set of activities: fetch-the-submission, and run-one-exec.
- The core workflow schedules those activities **pinned to the per-run task queue**, so Temporal routes each command to this container's agent. Each exec command is one activity invocation; its return value is the structured result; its heartbeats carry progress.

**Persistent connection: yes.** The agent holds a long-lived gRPC long-poll to the Temporal frontend for the run's lifetime; that poll *is* the persistent channel, and it is why the agent is long-lived rather than one-shot. It stays connected across all of the run's exec commands.

**Direction: outbound only, agent to Temporal.** Core never dials into the container. Both core and the agent connect *out* to the shared Temporal frontend; Temporal does the routing. This is the property that makes the model portable across executors: an inbound connection to a pod or allocation is difficult or impossible on Kubernetes and Nomad, whereas egress to Temporal (plus object storage and the telemetry collector) is available on every backend. The container needs no ingress.

**The startup race** is handled without an explicit signal: the workflow dispatches the container, then schedules the agent's first activity (fetch-the-submission), whose **schedule-to-start timeout is the readiness proof**. If the agent never connects to poll its queue, that timeout fires and the run fails with a diagnostic. Meanwhile the workflow polls the runner's liveness so a container that never comes up fails fast rather than waiting the timeout out. (An explicit "ready" signal from the agent is the alternative; schedule-to-start is preferred: the same guarantee with one fewer component.) That first exchange also carries the agent's **protocol version**: because ghost is baked into the environment image ([Decision 2](#2-the-runner-registry-and-executors)), a stale agent in an old image fails fast with "agent too old, rebuild environment" rather than a confusing activity-type mismatch.

**Why not a callback or a custom stream.** Once a persistent Temporal connection exists, an HTTP callback channel (the old ghost-webhook model) adds a second transport, a second auth surface, and a second failure mode without adding any capability; it is rejected in [Abandoned ideas](#http-callback-result-channel). A custom bidirectional gRPC stream (core pushes commands, ghost streams results) was also considered and rejected there: it would require core to host an ingest service and bridge a live socket into a workflow via signals, and it would take per-exec control away from the workflow, which is the opposite of [Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes).

This keeps the ghost change a **reuse of its existing executor core wrapped in a new agent loop** rather than a new orchestrator. ghost's command-execution, per-exec sandboxing, and object-storage *upload* already exist and are reused as-is; what is net-new is the long-lived Temporal worker loop, the per-exec result/stdio reporting, the *download* path for self-fetching inputs ([Decision 7](#7-submission-and-asset-delivery)), and the readiness/protocol handshake. (It is **not** an extension of the existing `ghost heartbeat` keepalive, which is an unrelated file-based liveness ticker, nor of any download capability; ghost was upload-only before this RFD.)

**Liveness is monitored for the whole run, not only at startup.** The readiness handshake covers "did the agent ever connect"; it does not cover an agent that connects and then dies mid-run (container OOM, node loss, agent crash). Without ongoing monitoring, a dead agent's per-run queue stops being polled and the next command stalls until its timeout, delaying failure across the remaining stages. The runtime therefore keeps a liveness check running for the run's duration (the runner backend's liveness probe), so container death is detected and the run failed promptly with a diagnostic rather than by timeout cascade. The corresponding case on the successful-startup path: a backend can report the job "running" while the agent's Temporal connection has in fact failed (bad credentials, wrong namespace). The committed behaviour is that a liveness failure during the pre-ready window fails the run immediately with a "container failed to start" diagnostic, rather than waiting out the first command's schedule-to-start timeout; the startup-timeout is only the fallback for the case where liveness still looks healthy.

### 4. Result emission and the persistence reshape

The pipeline is **score-blind**: a pipeline run emits, per (stage, scenario), exactly the [RFD 0013 `exec_result`](../0013/README.md#result-emission-contract): `command`, `args`, `exit_code`, `timed_out`, `skipped`, `error`, `started_at`/`ended_at`/`duration_ms`, and `stdin_uri`/`stdout_uri`/`stderr_uri`. No score appears on a result. This contract is fixed; the runtime implements it as written.

Two halves to the decision:

**Who emits what.** The ghost agent runs the exec, captures stdin/stdout/stderr to object storage (always; empty output is a zero-byte object with a valid URI, per 0013), and returns the structured fields. The core workflow owns the fields ghost cannot know on its own: `skipped` is set by the workflow when a dependency stage failed (dependency gating is the workflow's job, [Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes)), and the derived stage state (`success`/`failed`/`error`/`skipped` per the 0013 table) is computed by the workflow from its scenarios' results.

**The persistence reshape.** The existing result/score tables were built for the ghost-webhook era and contradict the contract; reconciling them is this RFD's responsibility (0013 explicitly assigned "what tables hold the records, what retires, what columns reshape" to the runtime). At the contract level, not the DDL level:

- A pipeline run's results are keyed by **(stage, scenario_code)**, not a flattened `case_code` string. The legacy `case_code = stage_name[/scenario_code]` flattening retires.
- **No `score` on a result.** Scoring moves entirely to formula evaluation ([Decision 5](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation)). The non-null per-result score column retires.
- The result **state set is 0013's**: `success`, `failed`, `error`, `skipped`, superseding the legacy `{success, failed, timeout}` enum (`timed_out` becomes a field, and `error`/`skipped` are first-class).
- Results carry **three stdio URIs plus the structured fields**, not two file paths. The URIs are opaque dereferenceable handles; the formula does not parse them.
- The **`evaluation.score.items` append-per-webhook model retires.** A score is produced once, by formula evaluation, in one transaction, not accumulated one row per callback. The legacy idempotency-for-webhook-retries concern disappears with the callback channel.
- A pipeline run's external identifier becomes its **Temporal workflow identity**, not a Concourse build id.

What this RFD does **not** decide is the physical storage shape: whether the per-run emission lives as rows, as a JSONB array on the run, or as an object-store blob. That is an implementation trade-off (queryability vs write-amplification) constrained by, but not determined by, the contract above.

### 5. Formula evaluation and score materialisation

Scoring is a **fan-in** step, not a per-result side effect. After all of a submission's pipeline runs complete, the parent workflow hands the collected results to the **report/evaluation extension**, which reshapes the `exec_result` emissions into the `pipeline.<name>.scenarios[<code>][<stage>]` view that 0013 defines, evaluates the formula's components and `scoring.total` against it, and materialises one score for the submission. This is a single report-extension activity the parent schedules at fan-in; see [§ Execution flow](#execution-flow).

This placement follows from the structure: the fan-out (N pipelines) and the fan-in (one formula over all N) both live in the workflow, so the workflow is the only place where the complete result set exists at once. This is the join that no container can perform.

Two nuances inherited from 0013, restated as runtime commitments:

- **Hard-fail is ungraded, never zero.** If any component's `score` or the `scoring.total` raises an evaluation error or yields a non-finite number, the submission is marked **ungraded** with a structured diagnostic. There is no path that treats the result as zero; a grader bug surfaces as a fixable problem rather than lost student marks.
- **Partial results are the formula's to handle.** A run whose container crashed mid-way produces a partial `scenarios` map; the formula's null-permissive predicates (`succeeded`/`failed`) and `try()` are how authors defend against it. The runtime's only obligation is to expose the partial map accurately and to distinguish "skipped" from "absent."

This is **net-new** capability: before this RFD core had the formula *parser* and validate phase but no evaluator and no parse phase. This leads to the one prerequisite this RFD surfaces, the **parse phase**, and to a refinement of how 0013 framed it. 0013 splits validation into a single-file validate phase (built) and a cross-file, document-resolving, dynamic-expanding **parse phase** (not built before this RFD), framed as one combined step over the pipeline+formula pair. This RFD **splits that parse along the extension boundary**, because the two halves have no runtime dependency: the pipeline never references the formula (0013's decoupling), so resolving the pipeline needs only its own config and the document.

- **Pipeline parse runs upfront, before dispatch**, in the pipeline extension: it resolves `document.examination`, expands dynamic blocks, and produces the concrete stages/scenarios and resolved exec specs the workflow executes. Failures fail the run before any container is dispatched, as 0013 specifies. This remains a **blocking prerequisite on the critical path**: a sizable standalone workstream (document resolution + dynamic-block expansion + resolved-exec-spec production), net-new work this RFD depends on but does not itself specify, and nothing dispatches before it lands. It must be tracked and staffed as its own deliverable.
- **Formula resolution + evaluation runs at fan-in**, in the report/evaluation extension, against the collected results. The pipeline run is score-blind and never touches the formula, so there is no reason to parse it upfront; and a structurally-broken formula does not waste the run, since results persist and a fixed formula re-scores them with no container re-run.
- **The two cross-file checks** 0013 placed in the parse phase (the `document` id must match across the pair, and the formula's `pipeline "<name>" {}` declarations must match pipeline blocks) need only the document and the pipeline's label list, not results. They are enforced at **generation/save time**, where the generator already builds both files from one document and runs the validate phase over each (`configgen.selfValidate`); the grading path does not re-check them.

Two commitments make the evaluation robust:

- **The resolved document and both config sources are snapshotted once, at run start**, into the grading workflow's state; this is inherent to the workflow, since Temporal records the parse activity's result in history, and is not a separate mechanism to build. The **parent parses once and threads the snapshot to the per-pipeline children**; children do not re-read config, keeping one submission on one config generation, and the formula evaluated at fan-in resolves against *that* document snapshot rather than a fresh fetch, so it scores against the same exam data the pipeline ran against. Without this, [0014's mutate-in-place](../0014/README.md#materialization-timing) configs admit a silent inconsistency: a save landing *between* dispatch and fan-in could pair a *new* formula or document with results from an *old* pipeline. The residual race, a save committing between run start and the snapshot read, is **accepted rather than locked against**: single-object reads are atomic, the affected set is the few submissions dispatched in that window, and the remedy is a re-grade.
- **Formula evaluation is a recoverable step, not inline orchestration.** Because the formula is arbitrary HCL evaluated against possibly-partial runtime data, an evaluation error or non-finite result must be *caught* and turned into the structured **ungraded** outcome; it must not crash the orchestration. This is the runtime realisation of 0013's hard-fail rule: ungraded is a first-class, recorded terminal state, distinct from "scored zero" and distinct from "infrastructure failed."

### 6. One pipeline run per pipeline

A config with N `pipeline` blocks produces **N pipeline runs per submission**, one row each, executed in parallel as N containers. This was the intent of 0013/0014 (the examination case is "one config grading many questions," each question its own pipeline) but the context was lost as out-of-scope; this RFD makes it explicit.

Consequences:

- A pipeline run is identified by (delivery, config, **pipeline label**), rather than just (delivery, config). The legacy one-row-per-(config, delivery) shape gains the pipeline-label dimension.
- "Submission grading" is the set of runs sharing a (config, delivery): a query view, not a table, consistent with 0013 § Terminology.
- The grading decomposes into a **parent Submission Grading Workflow per submission and a child Pipeline Run Workflow per pipeline run** (one container each); the parent fans out to the children and hands the collected results to the report extension's formula evaluation. This parent/child shape is **committed, not optional**: it is forced by three decisions already taken: a pipeline run's external id *is* its Temporal workflow identity ([Decision 4](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape)), per-pipeline-run workflows are what partition Temporal history ([Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes)), and workflow-id uniqueness is the re-grade enforcement point (below). See [§ Execution flow](#execution-flow) for the full decomposition and activity ownership.

Re-grading needs a decided **supersession rule**, because [0014](../0014/README.md#re-grading) allows re-running a delivery against the current config and that produces a *second* run for the same (delivery, config, pipeline label). The commitments:

- **The formula evaluates against the latest completed run per pipeline label.** Prior runs are retained for provenance/history but marked superseded; the fan-in selects the latest completed run per label (a label with no completed run ungrades, so a failed re-grade does not zero a good score). There is no ambiguity about which of two runs for `pipeline "q1"` feeds the score.
- **A re-grade does not silently coexist with an in-flight run for the same target.** A re-grade triggered while a prior grade for the same (delivery, pipeline label) is still running must resolve deterministically (reject, or cancel-and-replace) rather than letting two workflows write the same run's results concurrently. (Temporal workflow-id uniqueness is the enforcement point; the choice between reject and cancel-and-replace is open. ZINC's only existing singleton-workflow precedent, the environment builder, resolves the collision with `WORKFLOW_ID_CONFLICT_POLICY_TERMINATE_EXISTING`, i.e. cancel-and-replace, which is the default here unless there is a reason to prefer reject.)

### 7. Submission and asset delivery

The **ghost agent fetches its own inputs** from object storage (the submission files, plus the derived expected-answer assets the 0014 generator materialised, and any config assets) rather than having them streamed in by core. This matches the reference implementation and keeps the bulk submission I/O on the container ↔ object-storage path rather than proxied through core.

The nuance is that this is a genuine extension to ghost: before this RFD ghost only *uploaded* to object storage; *downloading* a submission prefix into the working directory is new behaviour the agent mode must add. Path-traversal defence on keys (a submission must not be able to write outside its working directory) is part of that behaviour.

Object-storage layout follows the existing ZINC convention and 0013's opaque-URI requirement: a per-run prefix under the course-code bucket, with stdio captured under `…/grading/<delivery>/<run>/<stage>/<scenario>/{stdin,stdout,stderr}`. The exact prefix scheme is a layout detail rather than a contract; the formula only sees opaque URIs.

### 8. Credentials and authenticating the agent

The container must authenticate two things, its **command channel** (to Temporal) and its **object-storage access**, and it must do so without holding any standing, broadly-scoped secret. The decision is a **per-run credential bundle**, minted by core at dispatch, injected by the runner backend (as environment/secret material appropriate to the executor), short-TTL (the run timeout plus a buffer), and revoked on completion or failure. What this section fixes is the bundle's *scoping model*; what it leaves to implementation is the bundle's **delivery transport and in-container retention** (env var vs file vs secret mount, held in agent memory only vs landing on a filesystem the student command can `stat`, and for how long), because that, not the scoping model alone, is the main attack-surface variable: it decides whether hostile in-container code can read the credential at all (see the reachability bullet below). The delivery/retention mechanism is to be prototyped and measured before it is locked.

- **Object storage: STS-scoped credentials.** Read-only on the submission prefix, write on the run's output prefix, the same model as the reference implementation. A leaked credential cannot be used outside this run's prefixes and expires with the run. STS scoping is the **target** for the object-storage half; whether ZINC's storage deployment can mint STS per run, and what the interim is if it cannot, is an [open question](#open-questions), and is itself gated by the delivery/retention prototyping above: a scoped credential delivered over a transport the student can read is no safer than a broad one.
- **Command channel: a per-run auth token for Temporal.** ZINC already has a cryptographic authority that issues scoped tokens: the ES384 JWTs behind authn session cookies and proctoring session bearer tokens (extension-registration tokens are signed separately, under the extension service's own key, and the pipeline webhook JWT has retired). The decision is to mint a per-run token from that same authority, scoped to the run's namespace/task-queue, and have Temporal validate it via a claim-mapper/authorizer. One caveat raises the cost above the minting itself: ZINC's Temporal deployment today runs with **no authorizer, claim-mapper, or token validation at all** (the client connects unauthenticated), so this is not a matter of *configuring* a stock mapper but of building Temporal's auth layer (server-side authorizer + claim-mapper, client-side token provider), which does not exist today. The trusted-network posture (below) is therefore the *de-facto initial state* this token work has to replace, not merely a weaker alternative one might choose. Once built, it gives the channel a cryptographic identity: knowing the (unguessable) per-run task-queue name is not, by itself, enough to impersonate the agent and take over its commands.

The threat model this must withstand: **the student submission is hostile and runs in the same container as the agent**, so it can attempt to read whatever the container holds. That reframes several points from "scoping" to "must-not-be-reachable," and the security review found gaps the bundle's one-line framing omitted:

- **The channel token must be scoped to *this run's* task queue, not to the namespace.** A namespace-wide token leaked to student code would let it register as a worker on *another* run's queue and complete activities with fabricated results, which is direct grade tampering. Temporal's stock claim-mapper is namespace-grained; per-task-queue scoping requires a custom authorizer. The committed design is per-run-queue scoping; the namespace-only posture is insufficient.
- **The object-storage write credential must be keyed to an unguessable per-run prefix.** If the write scope is broader than this run's own prefix, student code can overwrite a sibling run's stdout/stderr blobs; and since the formula consumes those blobs by URI, that is grade tampering with no Temporal involvement. Read scope is the submission (shared across a submission's runs); write scope is this run alone.
- **Credentials must not be reachable by the student command.** The agent and the student process share a container; the credential bundle must not be inheritable by spawned student processes (environment scrubbed before exec) nor readable from the agent's process via a shared UID / `/proc`. This makes the **agent a trusted execution context** that the student code must not be able to read, signal, or impersonate, a property the [isolation layers](#9-isolation-two-independent-layers) must enforce.
- **Isolation is multi-tenant as well as per-run.** Scoping must prevent a Course A container from reaching Course B's object-storage prefixes, queues, or data; credentials are scoped per course/activity as well as per run.
- **Revocation must survive abnormal exit.** "Revoked on completion or failure" only holds if the revoking actor is *core*, in a cleanup path that runs even when the container/workflow dies (see [cleanup below](#cleanup-and-orphans)). Backend-resident credential artifacts (a Kubernetes Secret, a Nomad job-spec env block) are not self-expiring the way an STS token is, so a missed cleanup is a standing exposure rather than a self-healing one.

Two posture decisions:

- **The trusted-network fallback (Temporal auth disabled) is not acceptable for production**, because production grading containers run hostile code; an unguessable queue name embedded in that container is a shared secret, not authentication. Token validation is a hard requirement where student code runs.
- **The shared-credentials + prefix-scoping fallback (the old Concourse posture) is unsafe with hostile code in-container** and is only admissible behind a server-side storage proxy that enforces prefixes (so the container never holds the broad credential). Whether ZINC's storage layer can mint STS credentials directly is an [open question](#open-questions); if it cannot, the proxy, not the raw shared credential, is the fallback.

<a id="cleanup-and-orphans"></a>
**Cleanup and orphans.** Per-run teardown (revoke credentials, remove the job and any backend credential artifact) runs in a context that **survives workflow cancellation or worker restart**; cleanup must not be skipped because the parent was cancelled. Because per-run cleanup can still be missed (core crash at the wrong time), a **periodic orphan sweep across every backend** is required: it must reclaim leaked jobs/allocations *and* leaked credential artifacts (e.g. Kubernetes Secrets, which a Job's finished-TTL does not garbage-collect). This is a committed capability of the runner layer, with backend-specific reclamation.

### 9. Isolation: two independent layers

Isolation is decided on **two axes that do not interact**:

- **Inside the container**, ghost applies a **per-exec process sandbox** to each command it spawns: filesystem restriction (Landlock) and a process limit (RLIMIT_NPROC). ghost does **not** attempt network-namespace isolation, so containing the student command's network is the *container* layer's job, not the per-exec sandbox's. This is the boundary around the *student's code* each time it runs.
- **Around the container**, the **runner backend** applies container/job-level isolation appropriate to the executor (e.g. a hardened container runtime / sandboxed runtime class, seccomp/AppArmor posture). This is the boundary around the *grading job* as a whole.

They are orthogonal in *what* they bound: the per-exec sandbox is the same regardless of which executor runs the job, and the container-level posture is chosen by the executor regardless of what ghost does inside. But they are **operationally coupled**, and a constraint on the inner layer follows: `unshare(CLONE_NEWNET)` requires **CAP_SYS_ADMIN**, which the hardened container drops (the outer layer drops all capabilities). So ghost does **not** attempt per-exec network-namespace isolation, and the student command shares the container's network namespace, including the egress the agent needs for Temporal and object storage. Retaining `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to make the inner netns work is rejected: it grants the *student* code the same namespace-and-mount power, widening the container-escape surface where the sandbox was meant to narrow it. The resolution is therefore **not** an inner-layer netns but the **outer layer**: either a **deny-egress container/cluster network policy** limiting the whole container to Temporal + object storage + the telemetry collector, or a **sandboxed-runtime class (gVisor/Kata)** that supplies per-exec network and namespace isolation from a user-space kernel with no host capability. The runtime class is preferable where available; the network policy is the minimum. (Earlier framing attributed this to seccomp/AppArmor permitting the syscall; the binding constraint is the capability, not the profile.)

Two related commitments follow from the [hostile-code threat model](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent), and, like the netns above, they collide with cap-drop-all, so the RFD states the *mechanism* as well as the goal:

- The student command runs under a **distinct, lower-privileged UID** from the agent (so it cannot read the agent's memory/descriptors or signal it). Transitioning UID needs **`CAP_SETUID`/`CAP_SETGID`**, which the hardened container therefore **retains, and only those two, not `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`**; the agent drops to the per-run UID as it spawns each command. A sandboxed-runtime class supplies the same UID separation without even those capabilities.
- The agent is hardened as a **trusted execution context**: `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` so its `/proc` is unreadable irrespective of UID, the credential environment scrubbed before exec, and its stdio-capture **staging agent-owned, `0700`, and outside any student-readable path** (not under a Landlock-granted `/tmp`), so a concurrent student process cannot race or symlink-redirect what gets captured and uploaded as the result.

### 10. Observability and log handling

The split is: **Temporal carries control, structured results, and progress; object storage carries the bytes.**

- **Structured outcomes and progress** ride the command channel: exec results are activity return values, and coarse progress (which stage/scenario, its state, timings) is visible through workflow state and activity heartbeats. Temporal records everything except raw log bytes.
- **Final stdout/stderr/stdin** are object-storage blobs referenced by the `exec_result` URIs; this is the durable record and is part of the 0013 contract. Log bytes never transit Temporal (whose payloads are size-bounded and not a streaming transport).
- **Tracing/logging** reuse ZINC's OpenTelemetry wiring; the runtime is instrumented end-to-end (dispatch, agent connect, each exec, formula eval) consistent with the rest of core.

A security nuance ties stdio handling back to [0013's deadline-gated visibility](../0013/README.md#visibility-block): the URIs a student is eventually allowed to see should be **dereferenced through access that is itself gated** (short-lived, issued at display time after the visibility filter has been applied) rather than being durable, directly-fetchable handles. And the materialised expected-answer assets (the 0014 generator's output) must live in a prefix segregated from student-reachable result prefixes, so that gaining a result URI does not imply the ability to enumerate adjacent answer keys. The egress restriction from [Decision 9](#9-isolation-two-independent-layers) is the second half of this: the grading container's egress is limited to Temporal, object storage, and the telemetry collector, not open to the cluster or the internet, so hostile code cannot exfiltrate data or reach internal services.

**Per-scenario progress is in scope; only live log-byte tailing is deferred.** Because [command granularity is per-exec](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes), every scenario is a Temporal activity, so Temporal already tracks each scenario's lifecycle (scheduled, started, then completed, failed, or retrying); the runtime does not build a separate per-scenario state machine, it reads the one the orchestration maintains. The grading workflow is the live state-keeper (its scenario-status map is durable and replay-safe by virtue of being workflow state), and it surfaces that map two ways. One half, a `status` **query handler** for snapshot reads, mirrors the existing `EnvironmentBuilderWorkflow`. The other half, a live per-scenario *push*, has **no drop-in precedent and is a transport decision rather than a reuse**: EnvironmentBuilder's own progress channel writes byte-progress to the Valkey cache and is polled back over HTTP, and ZINC's NATS layer today carries domain *events*, not workflow progress. The likely fit is a JetStream domain-event stream (the UI's existing event transport) rather than Valkey, but the choice is not yet made:

- **Live:** the workflow publishes a per-scenario transition to a realtime projection on each change: a JetStream domain-event stream (the `pipeline.events.*` subjects already exist as constants awaiting publishers) the UI subscribes to. A `status` **query handler** returns the current snapshot for initial load and reconnects.
- **Durable:** the per-scenario terminal state is the `exec_result` record persisted at run completion ([Decision 4](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape)); this is what the UI reads for a finished run.

The product UI reads these projections, **not Temporal directly**: Temporal's native activity state is the internal source and an ops/debug view, but it is retention-bounded and stops answering queries once a workflow closes, so it is not a product read-model. Temporal hands the workflow a *completion*, not a *start*, callback, so "queued vs done" is known natively, while a clear "executing now" needs either inferring it from pending-activity state or a start-heartbeat from the exec activity; the "in-flight = running" reading is usually sufficient.

**Live log-byte tailing remains deferred.** Streaming an in-progress exec's stdout/stderr to the UI before the blob is finalised is the separate concern, with its own transport question (a NATS subject vs incremental object-store chunks). It is left to a follow-up; the durable post-hoc record via the URIs is sufficient for grading correctness, and per-scenario *status* progress (above) already gives meaningful in-flight visibility without it.

### 11. Triggering and lifecycle

Grading runs across the **pipeline** and **report/evaluation** extensions (execution vs scoring), each a Temporal worker on its own task queue, with core owning credential minting and the triggers; see [§ Execution flow](#execution-flow) for the ownership map. It is triggered by the JetStream consumers that existed but were no-op before this RFD (`internal/api/pipeline/event.go`): delivery-finalised drives a grading run for that submission; the collection event drives scheduled/batch grading. The `501` pipeline-run endpoints become the manual/re-grade entry points to the same workflows; re-score is a separate synchronous endpoint on the report extension (`POST /v1/deliveries/{delivery_id}/rescore`), not a pipeline-run endpoint.

**Re-grading** follows 0014's "configs mutate in place": a re-grade is a new pipeline run against the *current* config; there is no historical-config snapshot to grade against. **Save-vs-grading-run ordering** (0014 deferred the mechanics to here) needs no dedicated locking mechanism: the run snapshots the resolved document + configs into workflow state at parse ([Decision 5](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation)) and is consistent from that point on. The only residual is a save committing between run start and that snapshot read; per [Decision 5](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation) that narrow, low-impact race is accepted (remedy: re-grade) rather than serialized against.

### 12. Admission control and batch fan-out

Grading dispatch is **bursty by nature** and the runtime must not treat the orchestrator as its admission controller. Two multipliers stack: one submission fans out to N pipeline runs (one per pipeline block), and one collection event (an exam closing) fans out to every submission in the collection at once. A 200-submission exam with 5 pipelines each is 1,000 containers to start at once.

The decision: **there is no application-level admission controller.** The burst is absorbed in Temporal. Fan-out enqueues workflow/activity tasks, not running containers; how many execute at once is governed by **executor-worker tuning** (per-worker concurrent-execution caps) and **task-queue rate limits**, so a 1,000-task burst drains through the executor pool at whatever rate the workers are configured to accept rather than starting 1,000 containers at once. The runner registry's load probing ([Decision 2](#2-the-runner-registry-and-executors)) stays **advisory**, input to *which* backend to prefer, and does not gate dispatch. This is a deployment/operations knob rather than orchestration logic. A global or per-collection hard cap is deferred unless a real workload measures the Temporal-native backpressure to be insufficient; and because Temporal has no native global semaphore, such a cap would be a dedicated gatekeeper-workflow rather than a parameter, worth building only if needed.

## Execution flow

The decisions above describe *what* the runtime does; this section fixes *how the Temporal pieces fit*: the workflow decomposition, the ordering, and which extension owns each activity. Concrete activity signatures remain implementation.

**Orchestration model.** ZINC's Temporal usage is cross-extension: an activity is owned by the extension whose domain it belongs to, each extension runs a worker on its own task queue, and a workflow orchestrates across extensions by scheduling activities on their queues; Temporal *is* the channel, so no separate inter-extension transport is needed. The grading runtime is an instance of that pattern, with one addition: the in-container ghost agent is an **ephemeral per-run worker** that joins a per-run task queue for the life of one run.

### Workflows

- **Submission Grading Workflow (parent)**: pipeline extension, one per (config, delivery). Owns the upfront pipeline parse, the snapshot, fan-out across pipelines, fan-in, and the hand-off to scoring. Surfaces the unified graded/ungraded terminal.
- **Pipeline Run Workflow (child)**: pipeline extension, one per (delivery, config, pipeline label). Its **workflow id is the pipeline run's external identifier** ([Decision 4](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape)), so workflow-id uniqueness enforces run supersession and resolves concurrent re-grades ([Decision 6](#6-one-pipeline-run-per-pipeline)). Owns one container's whole lifecycle; per-pipeline-run history partitioning keeps a single run's Temporal history bounded ([Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes)).

Scoring is **not** a third workflow: a single report/evaluation-extension activity, `ScoreSubmission`, evaluates the formula and persists the score in one step, scheduled by the parent on the report queue at fan-in. The same evaluate-and-persist path, invoked synchronously by the report extension's re-score endpoint against stored results, is how a **re-score without re-running** works (the score-blind result of 0013).

### Order of operations

**Parent (Submission Grading):** parse and expand the pipeline and resolve the document into a pinned snapshot, failing the run here, before any dispatch, on a parse error; then fan out one child per pipeline label, threading the snapshot down; then await all children and collect their `exec_result` sets; then schedule the report extension's `ScoreSubmission` against the latest completed run per label and the pinned document snapshot; then surface graded or ungraded.

**Child (Pipeline Run):** mint the per-run credential bundle (core); then select a backend and dispatch the container onto that backend's queue; then readiness gate (first activity's schedule-to-start, with liveness polling racing it); then `fetch-submission` on the per-run queue; then the DAG loop: per stage in topological order, schedule one `run-one-exec` per scenario in parallel on the per-run queue, derive stage state, gate downstream (mark `skipped`), fail-fast; then `persist-run-results`; then teardown (`cleanup-job` + `revoke-credentials`) in a cancellation-surviving context.

### Activity ownership

| Activity | Owner / task queue | Role |
|---|---|---|
| (trigger) start the parent | **core** event/API layer | JetStream consumers + the (formerly `501`) manual/re-grade endpoints |
| `parse-config` (pipeline parse, document resolution) | **pipeline ext** (document fetched from the examination domain) | resolve pipeline specs + pin the document snapshot before dispatch |
| `mint-credentials` / `revoke-credentials` | **core** (the cryptographic authority) | issue/revoke the per-run Temporal token + STS bundle |
| `select-runner` | **pipeline ext** (runner registry) | choose a backend (ordered list + circuit breaker; advisory load probe) |
| `dispatch-job`, `await-started`, `check-liveness`, `cleanup-job`, `orphan-sweep` | **per-backend executor queue** (Docker / K8s / Nomad), under the pipeline ext | place, monitor, and reclaim the container/job and its credential artifacts |
| `fetch-submission`, `run-one-exec` | **per-run queue** (ephemeral ghost agent) | pull inputs; run one resolved exec, capture stdio to object storage, return `exec_result` fields |
| `persist-run-results` | **pipeline ext** | durable `exec_result` writes |
| `ScoreSubmission` | **report/evaluation ext** | resolve + evaluate the formula against the pinned snapshot and persist one score, or ungraded, in one activity |
| `publish-progress` | each extension, for its own phase | per-scenario / per-phase transitions to the realtime projection ([Decision 10](#10-observability-and-log-handling)) |

### Task-queue topology

The ownership table is a map of *task queues*, and the mapping onto Temporal is direct: **a worker polls one task queue**, so each distinct queue is a distinct worker (workers in one process may share a Temporal client; a process can run several). Three tiers fall out, and they are what the runtime must wire:

- **Orchestration tier: one shared queue.** The parent and child workflows and the backend-agnostic activities (`parse-config`, `select-runner`, `persist-run-results`) run on the pipeline extension's grading queue. This tier holds the DAG and the pinned snapshot.
- **Placement tier: one queue per backend.** The per-backend queue is not bookkeeping; it is a *capability router*. `dispatch-job` / `await-started` / `check-liveness` / `cleanup-job` / `orphan-sweep` have to run on a worker that holds access to that orchestrator (the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API, the Nomad client), so the queue name *is* the address of the worker able to place containers there. Selecting a backend is selecting a queue; failover is selecting another. For Kubernetes and Nomad that worker is a **separate deployment** sited next to its control plane; Docker-only v1 is a single placement worker. The consequence for ZINC is concrete: an extension process today binds a *single* task queue, so the pipeline extension must grow to run multiple workers (the grading queue plus each backend queue it hosts in-process) or split placement into its own process, a wiring change this topology forces.
- **Execution tier: one queue per run.** The per-run queue needs **no core worker**: its only poller is the in-container ghost agent for that one run. Core never polls it; the child workflow addresses `fetch-submission` / `run-one-exec` to it by run id, and it is live only for that run's lifetime. (`mint-credentials` / `revoke-credentials` are core's capability but, being ordinary activities, run on an orchestration-tier worker that reaches the cryptographic authority, over NATS if the authority is not in-process, rather than requiring a Temporal worker on the core server, which does not exist today.)

### Signals & queries

- **`status` query**: both workflows expose a current snapshot for UI initial-load and reconnect; live per-scenario transitions are pushed to NATS ([Decision 10](#10-observability-and-log-handling)).
- **Cancellation**: cancellation is Temporal-native (`CancelWorkflow`, and re-grade's `TERMINATE_EXISTING`), not a custom `cancel` signal; children are terminated via the default parent-close policy. Per-run teardown survives a Temporal *cancel* via the cancellation-surviving path ([Decision 8](#cleanup-and-orphans)), but not a *terminate* (re-grade / parent-close), for which the mandatory orphan sweep is the fallback.
- Readiness needs no signal: the first activity's schedule-to-start is the gate ([Decision 3](#3-the-command-channel-ghost-as-a-temporal-worker)).

## Persistence summary

What this RFD commits to about persistence, at the contract level (physical shape is implementation):

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Pipeline run identity | One run per (delivery, config, pipeline label). External id = Temporal workflow identity. |
| Result keying | (stage, scenario_code) per the 0013 `exec_result` contract. No flattened `case_code`. |
| Result state | `success` / `failed` / `error` / `skipped`. `timed_out` and `error` are fields. |
| Result stdio | Three opaque object-storage URIs (`stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr`), always captured. |
| Score on results | None. Pipeline is score-blind. |
| Score production | Once, at formula fan-in, in one transaction. The per-webhook `items` append model retires. |
| Ungraded state | A first-class terminal outcome when formula evaluation hard-fails, distinct from "scored zero" and from "infrastructure failed." |
| Run supersession | Re-grade creates a new run; the latest completed run per pipeline label feeds the formula; prior runs retained for provenance. |
| Terminal-write idempotency | Completing / failing / cancelling a run is idempotent on run identity; a retried terminal write must not duplicate results or corrupt state. |
| Config snapshotting | No *historical* snapshot to re-grade against (0014: mutate-in-place). Within one run, the resolved document + both config sources are snapshotted once at run-start (in workflow state) and threaded parent to child, so execution and fan-in scoring share one consistent generation. |

## Out of scope / deferred

- **Live log streaming** to the UI (see [Decision 10](#10-observability-and-log-handling)).
- **Which executors ship first.** The registry interface is mandatory; the backend roster (Docker first; Kubernetes/Nomad designed-for) is an [open question](#open-questions).
- **The exec resource/security config schema**: a small follow-up to [RFD 0013](../0013/README.md) defines how a pipeline declares resource limits and security posture (with sensible defaults); this RFD consumes it as dispatch input ([Decision 2](#2-the-runner-registry-and-executors)) but does not specify it.
- **Toolkit reusability and plugin/framework result emission**: already deferred by 0013, unchanged here.
- **The 0014 generator and the v3 language**: inputs rather than subjects.
- **Manual/essay grading**: a 0014 open follow-up, unaffected.

## Abandoned ideas

Recorded so the same paths are not re-walked.

### ghost as the DAG orchestrator

The reference implementation runs the entire pipeline DAG inside the container via a full in-container worker. Rejected for ZINC because it puts a second HCL interpreter and the dependency-graph engine inside a container image (so language/grammar changes ship as image rebuilds), and because it splits the DAG logic (in-container) from the cross-pipeline fan-in for the formula (necessarily central), placing control of one grading in two components. Core-orchestrated keeps the language, the DAG, and the fan-in in one place ([Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes)) and keeps ghost a small, reusable executor.

### In-container child workflow

A middle option, keep core orchestrating but run a Temporal *child workflow* inside the container (as the reference implementation does for its eval step), was set aside. It would still require the in-container worker to carry pipeline logic, and it complicates the parent/child story without any gain over per-exec activities, given the DAG already lives in core.

### HTTP callback result channel

The retired ghost-webhook model had the container POST results back to a core endpoint. Rejected: once a persistent Temporal connection exists for commanding, a second HTTP channel for results is redundant transport, a second authentication surface (signed webhook tokens), and a second failure mode, with no capability the command channel lacks.

### Custom bidirectional command stream

A bespoke gRPC stream (core pushes exec commands, ghost streams results and logs over one long-lived socket) was considered as a literal reading of "maintain a channel." Rejected: a Temporal workflow cannot hold a socket, so core would need an ingest service and a long-running "session" activity to bridge the stream into the workflow via signals, and that bridge would take per-exec control away from the workflow, which defeats [Decision 1](#1-execution-topology-core-orchestrates-ghost-executes). Temporal-as-channel reuses the broker, the auth, the retries, and the visibility without extra work. The custom stream is worth revisiting only if per-exec activity overhead is later *measured* to be a problem.

### Pre-warmed / shared container pools

ZINC has a pre-warmed sandbox pool (`internal/sandbox/executor`) used elsewhere. Rejected for grading: a shared or reused container breaks the one-run-one-lifetime property that makes scoped credentials, per-run isolation, and clean filesystem state simple. The latency win does not justify reusing a container across submissions that must not see each other's credentials or files.

### Keeping score on the pipeline result

It offers continuity with the existing schema, but it contradicts 0013's score-blind pipeline, whose purpose is that changing the rubric does not touch the pipeline. Scoring lives only in formula evaluation ([Decision 4](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape), [Decision 5](#5-formula-evaluation-and-score-materialisation)).

## Open questions

- **Executor roster for v1.** Docker-in-Docker is the only backend ZINC has today. Do we ship Docker-only behind the registry and design Kubernetes/Nomad for later, or build a second backend immediately to prove the abstraction?
- **STS availability and credential delivery.** Can ZINC's object-storage deployment mint STS-scoped credentials per run? If not, do we accept shared-credential + prefix-scoping (behind a server-side storage proxy) as an interim, or invest in STS first? STS scoping is the target either way; the prior, gating question is the **delivery transport and in-container retention** of the whole bundle (env / file / secret mount; memory-only vs on-disk; lifetime): this sets the attack surface for hostile in-container code and must be prototyped before any mechanism is locked, because a tightly-scoped credential handed over a student-readable transport provides no benefit ([Decision 8](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent)).
- **Temporal auth posture.** Is the deployment's Temporal configured (or willing to be configured) with a token authorizer, or do we rely on the trusted-network fallback for the command channel ([Decision 8](#8-credentials-and-authenticating-the-agent))?
- **Physical result storage.** Rows vs JSONB-on-run vs object-store blob for the per-run `exec_result` array: a queryability/write-amplification trade-off the contract leaves open ([Decision 4](#4-result-emission-and-the-persistence-reshape)).
- **Container-crash diagnostics.** On container death mid-run, should the runtime fetch the container's own logs into the failure record (as the reference implementation does) to make "it just died" debuggable? A minor observability decision.
